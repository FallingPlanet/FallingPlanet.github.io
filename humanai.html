            <p class="text-lg mb-6">Our ongoing research with Kennesaw State University focuses on Human-AI Teamingâ€”exploring effective collaboration paradigms between humans and intelligent agents. The goal is to enhance trust, interpretability, and performance in complex tasks, from mission planning to critical decision-making.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Scope and Objectives</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
                <li>Developing interactive interfaces where humans and AI can jointly strategize solutions.</li>
                <li>Ensuring explainability in AI-driven recommendations and predictions.</li>
                <li>Exploring reinforcement learning and feedback loops for continuous improvement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-6">This project is still in its early phases, and we plan to publish working papers and demonstration videos as we progress. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
