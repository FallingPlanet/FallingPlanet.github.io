                <h2>William A. Stigall</h2>
                <p>I am a 22-year-old with a lifelong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Agents. I believe that everyone deserves an assistant reminiscent of Halo's Cortana, and I am dedicated to bringing that vision to reality. I enjoy applying AI solutions wherever possible, focusing on developing intelligent systems that enhance everyday life.</p>
                <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in AI and a minor in Data Science from Kennesaw State University. I am currently attending the Georgia Institute of Technology for a Master's of Science in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning.</p>
